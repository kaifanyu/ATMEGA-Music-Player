## Introduction

This C program is designed to run on an ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller. It allows users to play music through a speaker using a pre-recorded track or manual note input via a pinpad. The program supports playing individual notes with varying durations.

## Features

- Pre-recorded music track (example: "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star").
- Manual note input through a pinpad.
- Support for different note durations (whole, half, quarter, etc.).
- Pause and resume functionality.

## Setup

To set up this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller.
- Pinpad for user input.
- Speaker or audio output device.
- Appropriate power supply and connections.

Make sure you have the necessary development environment and toolchain for programming the ATMEGA32 microcontroller. Additionally, ensure that you have the required libraries for interfacing with the pinpad and speaker.

## Usage
