## Introduction

This C program is designed to run on an ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller. It allows users to play music through a speaker using a pre-recorded track or manual note input via a pinpad. The program supports playing individual notes with varying durations.

## Features

- Play and pause prerecorded songs.
- Switch between different songs during playback.
- Record and play custom music notes using the pinpad.
- Utilize '#' to resume and 'D' to pause the currently playing song.
- Display the currently playing song on the LCD screen.

## Setup

To set up this project, you will need the following hardware components:

- ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller.
- Pinpad for user input.
- Speaker or audio output device.
- Appropriate power supply and connections.

Make sure you have the necessary development environment and toolchain for programming the ATMEGA32 microcontroller. Additionally, ensure that you have the required libraries for interfacing with the pinpad and speaker.
