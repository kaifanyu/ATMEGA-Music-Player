## Introduction

This C program is designed to run on an ATMEGA32-16PU-ND microcontroller. It allows users to play music through a speaker using a pre-recorded track or manual note input via a pinpad. The program supports playing individual notes with varying durations.

## Features

- Play and pause prerecorded songs.
- Switch between different songs during playback.
- Record and play custom music notes using the pinpad.
- Utilize '#' to resume and 'D' to pause the currently playing song.
- Display the currently playing song on the LCD screen.
